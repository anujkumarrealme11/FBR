	  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <h2 id='intro'>Introduction</h2>
	  <div class='psec hoverp'>
       <p>The Friendly Batch Routing (FBR) application uses the Google Maps API to easily and simply gather route data for many origin-destination pairs. FBR is designed with usability in mind so that errors do not interrupt processing and skipped records can easily be resubmitted for processing. Additionally the FBR output can easily be imported into GIS packages.</p>
	   <p>There are two modes in the newest version of FBR.</p>
	   <ul>
		   <li>The <strong>Super friendly</strong> mode allows you to submit a small number of queries from any computer and retrieve the distance, time and number of instructions steprs to reach the destination.
		   <li>The <strong>Friendly and strong</strong> mode requires a server running PHP as well as a Google API key. The benefits are much faster requests, many more requests possible, path saving and trip duration, distance saved to a text file.
	   </ul>
	   <h3>Inputs</h3>
	   <p>A simple origin-destination address or lat/long pair</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1;London, UK;Cambridge, UK
			<li>2;43.5,7;Berlin, Germany
			<li>3;Paris, France;52.5,13.5
			<li>4;49,7;52.5,13.5
		</ul>

		<h3>Outputs</h3>
		<p>Super friendly and Friendly and strong modes:</p>
        <ul> 
			<li>the lat/long of the origin,</li>
			<li>the lat/long of the destination,</li>
			<li>travel time in seconds,</li>
			<li>travel distance in metres, and</li>
			<li>Google Maps direction steps (a complexity proxy)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Optionally in Friendly and strong mode:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the geometric path as a function of lat/long points.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Example</h3>
		<h4>Input:</h4>
		<pre>1;Luxembourg, Luxembourg;Walferdange, Luxembourg</pre>
		<h4>Output (timestamped):</h4>
		<p>2010-9-6-11-42-23_maindata.txt contents:</p>
		<pre>1	49.61	6.1296	49.65861	6.13249	673	6264	8</pre>
		<p>2010-9-6-11-42-23_pathdata.txt contents:</p>
		<pre>1	1	49.61000000000001	6.129600000000001
1	2	49.61009000000001	6.132210000000001
1	3	49.610800000000005	6.13168
etc... 56 lines</pre>
		<p><em>Please be aware that the Google Maps API has a query <a href='http://code.google.com/intl/fr/apis/maps/documentation/directions/#Limits'>limit</a> of 2,500 direction requests per day. If you are using Friendly and strong mode you may get charged for exceeding your free quota!</em></p>
       </div>

	  <!-- Server help-->
  	  <h2 id='help'>Server help</h2>
	  <div class='psec hoverp'>
		   <p>Please be aware that you need a server that runs PHP to be able to use FBR. Most computers can act as a server. Please make sure you have PHP functioning before testing FBR.</p>
		  <p>Here are a couple of questions that may help diagnose your server problems if you are trying to use <strong>Friendly and strong</strong> mode.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Is PHP running on your server? Are you running FBR on a server? Have you <a href='test.php'>tested a simple PHP script</a>?</li> <li>If you believe PHP works then try checking <strong>permissions</strong> of the 'output' folder, it should be writeable for all (chmod 777 output).</li>
			<li>You will also need to set the file <strong>key_file.txt</strong> as writeable (chmod 777 key_file.txt).</li>
			<li>Check if FBR is throwing JavaScript errors. Most browsers (Firefox/IE9+/Chrome) have an Error console of some sort.</li>
			<li>If you downloaded FBR a long time ago then try downloading it again. Google made some changes that required me to update FBR.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>PHP Test</h3>
		<p>Open <a href='test.php'>test.php</a> from your browser using the correct <strong>server URL</strong>. The test page should resemble <a href='imgs/result_of_test.png'>result_of_test.png</a>.</p>
		<p>If test.php displays a few lines of code then PHP is not functioning and you will need to install/configure PHP on your server.</p>
		</body>

	  </div>
	  
	  <!-- SETUP -->
  	  <h2 id='api'>Google API key</h2>
	  <div class='psec hoverp'>
		  <p>In 2013/2014 Google began limiting the number of sequential requests without using a personal key. You must follow these directions to add your key to FBR in order to do more than 50 or so requests.</p>
		  <p><a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key'>Activate your API key.</a></p>
		  <ol>
			  <li>Create a project.
			  <li>Activate Google Directions API.
			  <li>Create a new key, select the <strong>server key</strong>. Keep this SECRET.
			  <li>Do not define an IP address. This will prevent it from working.
			  <li>Copy the API KEY provided to the <strong>config.php</strong> file.
			  <li>This is a good time to customize the default search region of your requests in <strong>config.php</strong>. You can find a list of the acceptable region codes <a href='http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry'>here</a>.
			  <li>You <em>must</em> enable billing - register a credit card - for this service to work!
		  </ol>

		  <p>Common problems encountered:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>The file config.php must have sufficient permissions.
			  <li>You may need to disable ad-blocking software that dislikes ajax calls.
		  </ul>

	  <!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
	  <h2 id='doc'>Documentation</h2>
	  <div class='psec hoverp'>
	   <h3>Known issues</h3>
	   <p>The Google Maps API now (mid 2014) wants you to register your key to get results. It seems that FBR's requests are denied after 200 - 300 requests.</p>
	   <h3>Installation</h3>
	   <p>The FBR application has two modes, <strong>Super friendly</strong>, that can be run in any browser, and <strong>Strong and friendly</strong>, which must be installed on a server as it requires a PHP backend to capture the route data.</p>
	   <p>Download the FBR files and extract them onto your computer/server. Using a browser test to see if running FBR using the default values creates new records in the output folder. <strong>Check the HELP section below if you are having problems installing or getting the default values to run.</strong></p>
		<h3>Region</h3>
		  <p>If you are using Super friendly you should update the region in the main index.html file - see the line <pre>&lt;script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&amp;region=LU"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></p>
		<p>There's a list of region codes <a href='http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry' target='_blank'>here</a>.
	    <h3>Inserting your data</h3>
	    <p>The data you wish to input should be formatted in the following manner:</p>
		<pre>id;origin;destination</pre>
		<p>The formats of the origin and destination can be either a latitude and longitude seperated by a comma (49,-123) or an address string (vancouver, canada). Here are some example inputs:</p>
		<pre>1;London, UK;Cambridge, UK
2;43.5,7;Berlin, Germany
3;Paris, France;52.5,13.5
4;49,7;52.5,13.5</pre>
		<p><em>Mixing input formats as done above is discouraged!</em></p>
	   <h3>Options</h3>
	   <p><strong>Explicitly indicate input type (lat/long versus address string)</strong><br>
	   Unlike the examples above it is suggested that all the input origin-destinations be in the same format (<strong>id;lat,long;lat,long</strong> or <strong>id;string;string</strong> etc...). Further, it is strongly recommended that you explicitly indicate in what format (lat/long or string) you are submitting the records. It has been noted that a lat/long submitted as a string can return slightly different results than when submitted as a lat/long numercial value. While FBR tries to determine your input format automatically if it believes you have made an error, its guess is not always correct.</p>
	   <p><strong>Recording path coordinates</strong><br>
	   You may record the path lines but beware how you use or store them that it does not conflict with Google Maps API terms of service.</p>
	   <p><strong>Avoid highways</strong><br>
	   Allows you to avoid highways. Useful for simulating bike paths.</p>
	   <p><strong>Travel type</strong><br>
	   You can select the type of travel you would like the distance/directions for. Available options are DRIVING, WALKING, BICYCLING and TRANSIT. Note that cycling and transit directions are not widespread outside of North America. Using these travel types may return many or total retrieval errors due to no results being returned by Google Maps.</p>
	   <p><strong>Output formatting</strong><br>
	   Before running FBR you may choose a character to separate your output records. Select a comma if you wish to create CSV data.</p>
	   <p><strong>Pause time</strong><br>
	   This is the interval between direction requests to the Google Maps API. If you are requesting more than 2,500 requests you should wait 34 seconds per request so that you do not go over the maximum daily limit. Entering a pause value of 34000 milliseconds would allow you to submit 5,000 records over two days. Additionally having too short a pause duration can increase your chance of rejection from the Google Maps API server. There is a built-in delay of 500 milliseconds minumum. Combined with the default 400 millisecond option this creates a 1 second delay between request.</p>
	   <p><strong>Stop/Pause processing</strong><br>
	   Once processing has commenced you may stop processing. Those records already processed in the input window will be removed leaving the remaining records. Pressing start again will create a new file.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Retrieving your data</h3> 
	   <p>Super friendly mode provides the data in a text area below. You must copy this manually into your preferred text editor.</p>
	   <p>In Friendly and strong mode your data, upon processing completion, will be in the output folder located at the same location as your fbr.html file. The date-time_maindata.txt file will contain 1 record per record submitted. Each record will have:</p>
	   <ul>
		<li>the lat/long of the origin,</li>
        <li>the lat/long of the destination,</li>
        <li>travel time in seconds,</li>
        <li>travel distance in metres, and</li>
        <li>Google Maps direction steps (a complexity proxy)</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p>and optionally in the date-time_pathdata.txt file:</p>
	   <ul>
		<li>the geometric path as a function of lat/long points.</li>
	   </ul>
       <p>Unlike the main file the path file can contain hundreds, or more, lines per record submitted.</p>
	   <h3>Browsers</h3>
	   <p>FBR has been tested in <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/'>Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a href='http://www.google.com/chrome'>Google Chrome</a> successfully. I expect Safari to function properly as well. <strong>Internet Explorer 8 has some unresolved issues and is not recommended.</strong></p>
