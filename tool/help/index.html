<h2>FBR Help</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of questions that may help diagnose your problem.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is PHP running on your server? Are you running FBR on a server? Have you <a href='test.php'>tested a simple PHP script</a>?</li>
	<li>If you believe PHP works then try checking <strong>permissions</strong> of the 'output' folder, it should be writeable for all (chmod 777 output).</li>
	<li>If you are using the Friendly and Strong version of FBR you will also need to set the file <strong>key_file.txt</strong> as writeable (chmod 777 key_file.txt).</li>
	<li>Check if FBR is throwing JavaScript errors. Most browsers (Firefox/IE9+/Chrome) have an Error console of some sort.</li>
	<li>If you downloaded FBR a long time ago then try downloading it again. Google made some changes that required me to update FBR.</li>
</ol>

<h3>PHP Test</h3>
<p>Open <a href='test.php'>test.php</a> from your browser using the correct <strong>server URL</strong>. The test page should resemble <a href='result_of_test.png'>result_of_test.png</a>.</p>
<p>If test.php displays a few lines of code then PHP is not functioning and you will need to install/configure PHP on your server.</p>
